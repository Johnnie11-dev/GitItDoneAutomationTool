Whether you're in the middle of a fast-paced development cycle or just want to save time, this tool has you covered.

## Features
- **Automated Commit Messages**: Generate default commit messages with a timestamp or provide your own.
- **Push to Any Remote**: Specify the remote repository you want to push changes to (defaults to `origin`).

   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Command
To commit all changes and push to the current branch with a default commit message:
```bash
python gititdone.py
```

### With a Custom Commit Message
To commit with a custom message:

```

### Push to a Custom Remote

```
